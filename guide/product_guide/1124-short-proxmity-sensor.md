The sharp distance proximity sensor is a sensor for distance measurements. This sensor is typically used for measuring shorter ranges(approximately 4 cm to 30 cm (1.5″ to 12″)), although it is quite accurate.

## How it works
The component uses a specific light sensor to detect a light wavelength in the Infrared (IR) wave spectrum. The intensity of the light is received when an object is close to the sensor. The light bounces off the object and into the light sensor, which results in a change to the intensity.

## Programming
<!-- ![](/img/docs/product_guide/2290(4).jpg) -->

The following code demonstrates how the short proximity sensor works and measures the distance when the sensor is moved
towards or away from an object, within the range of 4-30cm. If you want to skip the steps, you can jump to the Full Code. 

**Step 1:** Create variables for the sensors pin and a variable to store the data that is collected 

```c
int sensor = A0; //sensor pin connection
```

**Step 2:** Set up serial communication, set the **sensor** pin as an **INPUT**. 

```c
void setup() {
 Serial.begin(9600); // start the serial port
 pinMode(sensor, INPUT); //setting the pin to the Arduino
}
```

**Step 3:** Read the data from the **sensor**, and convert the data into a volts measurement

```c
void loop() {

 //5V
 float volts = analogRead(sensor)*0.0048828125;  // value from sensor * (5/1024)
```

**Step 4:** Now convert the volts measurement into distance, a measurement we understand.
**This calculation is found in the datasheet gragh of the component and can be found [here!](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/7571/4865/files/datasheet_GP2Y0A41SK0F.pdf?325)**
```c
int distance = 13*pow(volts, -1); // worked out from datasheet graph
 delay(1000); // slow down serial port 
```

**Step 5:** Finally use the distance we calculated and display ONLY when the distance is less than or equal to its max limit.
```c
if (distance <= 30){
   Serial.println(distance);   // prints the distance
 }
}
```

## Full Code

```c
int sensor = A0; //sensor pin connection

void setup() {
 Serial.begin(9600); // start the serial port
 pinMode(sensor, INPUT); //setting the pin to the Arduino
}

void loop() {

 //5V
 float volts = analogRead(sensor)*0.0048828125;  // value from sensor * (5/1024)
 int distance = 13*pow(volts, -1); // worked out from datasheet graph
 delay(1000); // slow down serial port 
 
 if (distance <= 30){
   Serial.println(distance);   // prints the distance
 }
}
```

## Output
Serial Monitor will display distance that is measure from the proximity sensor, only if the distance measure is less than or equal to the max limit which is 30cm for this exact component.
